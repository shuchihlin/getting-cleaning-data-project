## This code book describes the tidy data set (the "tidyData" object) generated by the R-script: "run_analysis.R"

1. Details of the source data can be found in README.txt file in the source data at 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. The following provides an explanation of each column of the final tidy dataset:
   1. Overall the "tidyData" has:
     * 180 rows (each row represnts the average of measurements from 1 of 30 volunteers doing 1 of 6 activities) 
     * 563 columns ("Activity" and "Subject" along with the corresponding 561 variables as listed in "features.txt" of the source data)
   2. Activity:
     * the activity being measured (one of "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", "LAYING" activities)
   3. Subject:
     * the number which tracks the volunteer (1..30)
   4. 561 columns as listed in source data's "features.txt":
      - the single letter prefix indicates the domain (t: time, f: frequency)
      - the second component of the name indicates whether the measure applies to the subject's body or to the component due to gravity
      - the third component of the name indicates the type of measure
        * Acc: linear acceleration
        * Gyro: angular velocity
        * AccJerk: rate of change of acceleration
        * GyroJerk: rate of change of angular velocity
      - the fourth component of the name indicate the type of statistic
        * mean: mean
        * std: standard deviation
        * mag: magnitude
      - the fifth component, where applicable, indicate the 3-axial signals in the X, Y or Z direction
